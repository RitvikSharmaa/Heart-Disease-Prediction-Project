# 🫀 Heart Disease Prediction

An end-to-end machine learning project to predict the likelihood of heart disease using clinical data. The goal is to support early diagnosis and preventive care through accurate predictions.

## 📌 Project Highlights

- Cleaned and preprocessed heart disease dataset
- Explored data using visualizations (EDA)
- Trained and compared multiple machine learning models
- Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC
- Built an interactive Streamlit app for real-time predictions

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Streamlit

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used is a publicly available heart disease dataset, including features like age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more.

## 🚀 Getting Started
